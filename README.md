Due to the Cloudflare incident, I wasn’t able to access the ICCM Leaderboard.

So I decided to build this static website to avoid relying on Cloudflare—unless my own hosting goes down, of course.

All data is pulled directly from the @iccm.eth API.

I also added a few extra metrics to make the final results easier to read.
