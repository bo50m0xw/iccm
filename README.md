Due to the Cloudflare incident, I wasn’t able to access the ICCM Leaderboard.

So I decided to build this static website to avoid relying on Cloudflare—unless my own hosting goes down, of course.

I’m a no-coder, so I had to ask GPT to build this for me. Don’t blame me 😂

All data is pulled directly from the @iccm.eth API.

I also added a few extra metrics to make the final results easier to read.

f*uckitwebase #ICCM with love
